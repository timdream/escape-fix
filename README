 Very simple script that fixes escape code in Mozilla l10n files,
 i.e. turn your legacy \uXXXX in strings into real UTF-8 chars.

 To run it, do 

     $ find | grep -v \.hg | xargs php escape-fix.php

 in the repo directory.
 the "grep -v \.hg" is very important, otherwise you could ruin your repo
 directory.
